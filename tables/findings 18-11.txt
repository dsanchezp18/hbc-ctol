As pointed out previously, the spike in corruption tolerance in Ecuador happened at the same time as other key events in the sociopolitical and economic landscapes of the country. First, a recession hit Ecuador beginning 2015 due to a commodity price collapse. Constrained fiscal revenues due to reduced oil prices limited the possibility of expansionary fiscal policy, and a dollarized economy frustrated any monetary efforts to offset the crisis. Figure \ref{fig:ecua_ec} displays economic conditions, both observed and perceived, of the country from 2004-2019.

Figure \ref{fig:ecua_ec} shows that in 2008 the commodity price collapse was greater than the one in 2014. However, \textbf{El Comercio Crisis} holds that in 2008 there was no reduction in economic activity due to oil price shocks, as the country had greater possibilities of international financing and also savings left over from past oil funds which were used to keep expansionary fiscal policy underway. Combined with exports competitiveness due to US dollar appreciations, the Ecuadorian fell into a \enquote{three-pincer trap} \textbf{Cordes analisis, p.1} which threatened to stagnate growth unless significant reform were to happen. President Correa himself admitted the sluggish performance of the economy not far from the 2017 presidential elections \textbf{cite el PaÃ­s.} It is likely that the economic circumstances, combined with accusations of corruption and attacks to the freedoms of press \textbf{Amazon Post}, \textbf{El Universo}, along with harsh repression of environmentalist and indigenous-backed protest \textbf{WPR} could have led to \enquote{popular backlash against his style of controntational politics} (Shifter, in Miroff, 2014). Figure \ref{fig:ecua_pol} shows several indicators of political culture in the country from 2004 to 2019. The AB data shows that indeed the President reached an all-time high popularity in 2014 and then a severe drop in 2016. Another notable in change in the political landscape in this period is the way that voting-age population identified politically. There was a notable increase of the people who identified in the \enquote{right} spectrum of the political compass, while those who identified did not see significant changes. 

\subsection{Key regressors for the corruption tolerance jump}

From the previous section, several variables that may have something to do with the corruption tolerance jump have come up. These variables have changed significantly during the 2014-2016 period and somewhat follow lines of reasoning in the literature. Two economic variables at the individual level significantly changed during the period: the percent of people who report a worse economic situation relative to a twelve month period as well as the unemployment rate. These follow macroeconomic indicators for the Ecuadorian economy too. Variables which proxy attitudes in the political landscape also have significantly changed: the percent who confide in the President, the percent who approve the President's job and also the percent of people who identify with the political right wing.

Simple empirical models are estimated to study the relationship of these key changes in the probability of answering \enquote{Yes} in the corruption tolerance question of the AB, which follow the following equation.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:simplemod}
P(ctol = 1 | \textbf{\textit{X}} \hspace{0.04cm}) = G \left[ \beta_0 + \delta_0 y_{16} + \beta_1 x^* + \delta_1 (y_{16} \cdot x^*) + u\right]
\end{equation}

where $x^*$ is

\begin{itemize}

\item A dummy variable equal to unity for respondents who answered that their economic situation is worse relative to the one twelve months ago and zero otherwise.

\item A dummy variable equal to unity for respondents who report being unemployed in an either open or hidden manner (see Appendix \ref{app:first}) and zero otherwise.

\item A discrete variable with numbers 1-7, where higher numbers imply a higher degree of confidence in the President.

\item A discrete variable with numbers 1-5, with higher numbers implying a higher rating of the President's job performance.

\item A discrete variable with numbers from 1-10 where 1 is the extreme left and 10 is the extreme right. 

\end{itemize}
